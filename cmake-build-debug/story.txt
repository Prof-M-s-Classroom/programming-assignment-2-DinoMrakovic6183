1 | WELCOME TO: (Tod the Manaless? Wizard) You are in history class, your teacher is discussing merlin the wizard while you drift off to sleep. As you wake up, a snively voice says in a mocking tone, "I bet he doesn't have any mana!" and a group of chittery voices laugh and snicker. You stumble upwards and find yourself in a damp cave, a gang of goblins surrounding you. The previous chatter and laughter you heard while you was still lying down has turned to utter silence. The smallest goblin musters up some courage and steps up, facing you and speaks with a quivering voice, "I'm D-d-dibby, and I'd l-l-like it if you help us defeat t-t-the evil w-w-wizard guarding the way out of this c-c-cave." -(See Dialogues)- | 2 | -1

3 | DIBBY: "We don't know! He said if we try to escape, he'll use his mana to kill us. We spent the last three days looking for a mighty, good wizard, like you, to save us!" -(See Dialogues)- | 5 | -1
4 | 1-("Yes, Dibby. I will help you on this quest!")-2-(See More Dialogues)- Page 2/3 | 6 | 9
5 | 1-("Yes, Dibby. I will help you on this quest!")-2-("Nah, I think imma go further into the cave.")- | 6 | 10

7 | -("Tod")--("Mr. Goblin Killer")- | 8 | 11
8 | DIBBY: "MISTER TOD OUR HERO!!! (all the goblins erupt in cheering)" Dibby leads you towards the exit of the cave, the rest of the goblins trail behind you. The only noise is the group's steps splashing in the murky cave water, echoing further down the tunnel. -(See Dialogues)- | 12 | -1
9 | 1-("Nah, I think imma go further into the cave.")-2-(Back to First Dialogue)- Page 3/3 | 10 | 2

11 | DIBBY "Erm, r-r-right, I'll call you m-m-mister G.K." Dibby leads you towards the exit of the cave, the rest of the goblins trail behind you. The only noise is the group's steps splashing in the murky cave water, echoing further down the tunnel. -(See Dialogues)- | 12 | -1

14 | You begin to hear a faint voice, chanting in some foreign language. It's too far for you to distinguish the exact words being said. DIBBY: "That's the e-e-vil wizard, he's casting a spell to try and f-f-find us." -(See Dialogues)- | 15 | -1
15 | 1-("Let's make a plan")- | 16 | -1
16 | 1-("You all run up to distract him, and I'll sneak around and hit him while he isn't looking.")-2-("Dibby, you try to talk to him, the rest of us will look for small rocks and sharp things to throw at him while he's distracted.")- | 17 | 43
17 | DIBBY: That's a good idea, but aren't you going to use magic? You are a wizard after all. | 18 | -1

19 | 1-(I passed [rolled a 10 or higher])-2-(I failed)- | 20 | 42

21 | 1-("My plan will work")-2-("Let's try something else")- | 22 | 16
22 | The goblins all jog up to a bend in the tunnel, a dim light shines through it. Once they reach the bend, Dibby lets out a warcry and the goblins all charge in. -(See Dialogues)- | 23 | -1

25 | You sneak through the opening, revealing a murky cave room outfitted with lavish decor and furniture. Darting behind chairs and cabinets, blending into the shadows, you sneak up to the evil wizard and prepare to strike. -(See Dialogues)- | 26 | -1
26 | 1-(Karate chop the nape of his neck, attempting to incapacitate him, as seen in cartoons.)-2-(Reach out to twist his head in a quick motion, snapping his neck)- | 27 | 27
27 | You hear a roaring cheer from all the goblins, "He's gone, finally we're free!!!" All of the goblins except Dibby scurry out of the cave in a large green tidal wave. Dibby looks up at you, he looks unsure of whether to follow his gang or to stay with you. -(See Dialogues)- | 28 | -1
28 | 1-("Go with them, Dibby. Be free!")-2-("Dibby, will you marry me?")- | 29 | 49
29 | Dibby nods and runs away quickly, trying to catch up with his gang. You step through the cave's exit, into the moonlit forest, and thus concludes your manaless? adventure in the goblin cave. | -1 | -1
30 | You continue deeper into the tunnel, the darkness of the cave obstructs your vision and the splashing sounds clutter your hearing. You and the goblins walk up to a bend in the tunnel, a dim light shines through it. Through the opening, you see a murky cave room outfitted with lavish decor and furniture. Once you and the goblins all walk through the opening, the evil wizard finishes chanting his spell, EVIL WIZARD: "SWIMP SWOSH WIMPLE HOBOG!!!" A roaring fire circles around the evil wizard, desintegrating every goblin, even Dibby. -(See Dialogues)- | 31 | -1
31 | 1-("HOW COULD YOU KILL DIBBY!!!")- | 32 | -1
32 | EVIL WIZARD: "Because I told him and all the other goblins exactly what would happen if they tried to escape." -(See Dialogues)- | 33 | -1
33 | 1-("Why were you even keeping them hostage in the first place?")- | 34 | -1
34 | EVIL WIZARD: "These goblins were useless jabbering creatures. Compared to us brilliant wizards, their mana was pitiful! I only kept them in here because the Council of Awesome and Brilliant Wizard Guys stationed me here. Speaking of, clearly you are a wizard, but I don't recognize you from the council, why is that?" -(See Dialogues)- | 35 | -1
35 | 1-("I'm not a wizard, I'm not even from wherever this place is!")- | 36 | -1
36 | EVIL WIZARD: "Not a wizard? But you look just like one! Oh well, if you're not a wizard, that means you couldn't possibly have this much MANAAAAA!" The evil wizard starts taunting you, showing off his mana whilst he waltzes around the room. EVIL WIZARD: "Let's see just how much mana you do have! Goomble wooble wiggle dop!" A very dim glow lights up around your silhouette, barely visible at a glance. EVIL WIZARD: "I-is that, COULD IT BE? NO MANA!!!" the wizard shouts, while spitting in your face. The evil wizard laughs as a gust of wind hits your face, the evil wizard lets out a bright glow around his silhouette, lighting up the back of the room. EVIL WIZARD: "Loooook, LOOK AT MY MANAAAAAA!" he says, taunting you while he resumes waltzing around the room. -(See Dialogues)- | 37 | -1
37 | 1-(Endure his mocking)- | 38 | -1
38 | You wind back your fist, while the wizard begins chanting a spell. EVIL WIZARD: "JABBLE PRUNGUS WREFFLE YABOP!!!" A bolt of lightning jolts out from the wizard's hands, aimed at you. At the last possible moment, it curves over your head and blasts the cave opening you came through. With perfect form, you wind up a simple jab and strike the wizard, instantly knocking him out cold. -(See Dialogues)- | 39 | -1
39 | You look past the wizard and see an opening on the other side of the cave room, a dim moonlight shining through it. The exit. -(See Dialogues)- | 40 | -1
40 | 1-(Exit the cave)- | 41 | -1
41 | You step through the cave's exit, into the moonlit forest, and thus concludes your manaless? adventure in the goblin cave. | -1 | -1
42 | You think to yourself: "There's no way I could be a wizard! Silly goblin doesn't know what he's talking about" -(See Dialogues)- | 21 | -1
43 | DIBBY: "That's a good idea!" Dibby nervously walks up to a bend in the tunnel, a dim light shines through it. Once he reaches it, he waits for you to give him a signal. -(See Dialogues)- | 44 | -1
44 | 1-("Point towards the entrance, then smack your fist into your other palm, drag your finger across your throat, and give Dibby a thumbs up")-2-("Mimic running with your arms, do some shadowboxing moves, then give Dibby a thumbs up")- | 45 | 45
45 | Dibby nods, chargin in alone. You and the other goblins feel around the floor and walls, grabbing loose stones, then you all pour into the small opening. You find yourself in a murky cave room outfitted with lavish decor and furniture. You and all the goblins each wind up your hands and toss your rocks at the evil wizard. EVIL WIZARD: "SWIMP SWOSH WIMPLE HOB-" Your rock strikes the evil wizard's forehead, knocking him out cold before he could cast his final spell. -(See Dialogues)- | 46 | -1
46 | 1-("He's out, now where's the exit?")-2-("Finish him, Dibby. Make sure he won't trap you ever again!")- | 27 | 47
47 | Dibby and the goblins take turns smacking the evil wizard with rocks, then poke him after to make sure he's dead. You hear a roaring cheer from all the goblins, "He's gone, finally we're free!!!" All of the goblins except Dibby scurry out of the cave in a large green tidal wave. Dibby looks up at you, he looks unsure of whether to follow his gang or to stay with you. -(See Dialogues)- | 28 | -1
48 | 1-("Okayyy fine.")- | 6 | -1
49 | DIBBY: "YES, YES I WILL!!!" You and Dibby move into a nice cave and live happily ever after, THE END. | -1 | -1
