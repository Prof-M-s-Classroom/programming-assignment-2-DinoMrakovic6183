1 | You are in history class, your teacher is discussing merlin the wizard while you drift off to sleep. As you wake up, a snively voice says in a mocking tone, "I bet he doesn't have any mana!" and a group of chittery voices laugh and snicker. You stumble upwards and find yourself in a damp cave, a gang of goblins surrounding you. The previous chatter and laughter you heard while you was still lying down has turned to utter silence. The smallest goblin musters up some courage and steps up, facing you and speaks with a quivering voice, "I'm D-d-dibby, and I'd l-l-like it if you help us defeat t-t-the evil w-w-wizard guarding the way out of this c-c-cave." -(See Dialogues)- | 2 | -1

8 | DIBBY: "MISTER TOD OUR HERO!!! (all the goblins erupt in cheering)" Dibby leads you towards the exit of the cave, the rest of the goblins trail behind you. The only noise is the group's steps splashing in the murky cave water, echoing further down the tunnel. -(See Dialogues)- | 12 | -1

14 | You begin to hear a faint voice, chanting in some foreign language. It's too far for you to distinguish the exact words being said. DIBBY: "That's the e-e-vil wizard, he's casting a spell to try and f-f-find us." -(See Dialogues)- | 15 | -1
